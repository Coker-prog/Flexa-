                    <p className='text-sm '>Flexa was established in response to a pressing need within the Nigerian banking sector: 
                        a need for reliable, affordable, and consistent banking services for SMBs. The Central 
                        Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has recognized the critical role that microfinance banks play in driving 
                        financial inclusion and supporting the growth of the economy. In line with CBN regulations and 
                        initiatives, Flexa is dedicated to providing transparent and efficient financial solutions.
